# Doxyfile 1.8.4

# This Doxygen config is used to generate a 'docset' package for use with
# Xcode's documentation viewer and the Dash app.
# See: http://developer.apple.com/tools/creatingdocsetswithdoxygen.html

# WARNING: This config file should be run from within an Xcode build, via the
# 'build_docs.sh' script that's run by the "Documentation" target.
# Some of the settings below are based on environment variables that are only
# set up by that script, so you can't just run 'doxygen' from the command line.

/** An in-memory object cache.
    It keeps track of all added objects as long as anything else has retained them,
    and it keeps a certain number of recently-accessed objects with no external references.
    It's intended for use by a parent resource, to cache its children.
 
    Important:
    * Every object added must have a unique and fixed .cacheKey value.
    * If ARC is not enabled, an object can belong to only one CBLCache at a time. */

## libSQLCipher.a goes here

In order to build the Xcode project's `CBL Mac+SQLCipher` target, copy a 64-bit Mac OS static library of SQLCipher to `libSQLCipher.a` in this directory.

Currently, you can download such a pre-built library from [our forked SQLCipher repo](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-lite-libsqlcipher), in the `libs/osx` directory.

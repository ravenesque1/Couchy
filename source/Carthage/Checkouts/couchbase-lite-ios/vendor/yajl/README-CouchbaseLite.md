This is a snapshot of YAJL 2.0.5 taken from https://github.com/lloyd/yajl , master branch, commit 4c539cb5b48c41cecbbf3a0afcbd293de33abfc8.

I originally tried using it as a submodule, but it can't be compiled until it's been configured
and built using the Makefile, which was too much of a pain to do via Xcode (especially since
the build requires Cmake.)
